The above code files are using a dummy dataset to demonstrate the capability of our reconstruction algorithm.
First make sure you have the PETSC library (https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) since our code uses the mesh framework from this library.
Then compile and run the .c code.
A text file containing the solution vector will be produced.
This is then read by MATLAB to generate a conductivity map.
The resulting bio-scan can be viewed and is stored above as a .jpg file.
